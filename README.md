# test-gb

First testing for CMake usage. The project is a simple manually made .json parser with a specific output format.

## Usage

Execute the .bat file to use the CMake tool and build the project in the output folder
```
/TEP_Build
```
if you're on Windows. If you're on linux, I'm so sorry :(
After that you'll end up with the Visual Studio project and you can open it via the .sln file.
